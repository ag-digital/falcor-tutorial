# falcor-tutorial
An example of a simple falcor server

## To get started

* git clone the project
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`

You can then browse to the site by going to `http://localhost:3000`

A get request is sent to the falcor server in `app.js`. A [Hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) route has been setup in `index.js` which directs the request to the falcor router.
The falcor router is defined in `AppFalcorRouter.js`.
